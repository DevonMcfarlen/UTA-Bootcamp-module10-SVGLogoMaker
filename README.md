  ## Description <a name="description"></a>
  
  This a a small program to help users make a quick and simple logo in the svg file format. All you have to do is answer the simple questions the program prompts you with, and it will create your logo! <br> Creating this program taught me how to create svg files through text, and how to check that the files match the expected output.
